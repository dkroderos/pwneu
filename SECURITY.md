# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open an issue or pull request**.  
Instead, please report it privately by emailing:

ðŸ“§ [dk.roderos@proton.me](mailto:dk.roderos@proton.me)

We will review and address the issue as soon as possible.

## Voluntary Pentesting

If you would like to voluntarily pentest the platform, please email  
[dk.roderos@proton.me](mailto:dk.roderos@proton.me) to request permission before conducting any tests.

We will provide an **isolated environment** for security testing. Unauthorized testing on production systems is strictly prohibited.

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure.
